Feature: [JIRAKEY-9123] Quick Search by ID

    
    In order to be able to quickly display an entity
    As a user
    I should have access to a quicksearch by ID component
    where I should be able to type the ID of an entity
    and press the enter key or click the "Search" button.

    Requirements
    --------------
    * The textbox should be visible, with no value
    * The search and reset buttons should not be visible
    * When the user types a search term, the "Search" and "Reset" button should become visible
    * When the user clicks the "Reset" button, the textbox should clear
    * When the user clicks the "Search" button OR presses the ENTER key, a search is performed:
        - If an entity with the ID is found, the user should be redirected to the entity's page, and the searchbox should return to its initial state
        - If an entity with the given ID is not found, the border of the textbox should become red, indicating an error.
